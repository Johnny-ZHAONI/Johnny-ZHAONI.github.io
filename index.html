      <h2>The Morning</h2>
      <p>
        Beijing, early morning. The street is still gray.
        Xiangzi wakes up in a small rented room. His body is sore,
        but his dream is simple: one day, he will own his own rickshaw.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, he has a choice. He can go out and pull the rickshaw,
        saving every coin. Or he can stay inside, rest his tired body,
        and ignore the world outside for one day.
      </p>

      <p class="question">If you were Xiangzi, what would you do?</p>

      <div class="choices">
        <a class="choice choice--yes" href="street.html">
          YES — Go out and pull the rickshaw
        </a>
        <a class="choice choice--no" href="rest.html">
          NO — Stay inside and rest
        </a>
      </div>
