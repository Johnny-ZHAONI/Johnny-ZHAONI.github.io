        Xiangzi lies back down. The bed is thin, and the room is small, 
        but for one moment, he lets himself be lazy. 
        The noise from the street is distant, like another city, another life.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thinks about his dream. A rickshaw of his own, shiny and strong, 
        under his control. But the dream feels far away when his body is so tired.
      </p>

      <p>
        After some time, guilt arrives. Every hour he stays inside is an hour 
        without money. Outside, other pullers are already working. 
      </p>

      <p class="question">
        He sits up. Should he change his mind and go out now, 
        or accept that today will be a lost day?
      </p>

      <div class="choices">
        <a class="choice" href="street.html">Change your mind — go out anyway</a>
        <a class="choice" href="ending.html">Stay — accept the lost day</a>
