        Evening falls over Beijing. Whether Xiangzi worked on the street
        or stayed inside, the day slips away, hour by hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he worked, he has a few more coins in his pocket,
        but also more pain in his legs and back.
        If he stayed inside, his body is lighter,
        but his dream feels further away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city does not remember his choice.
        The tram still runs. The shops still close.
        The night still comes.
      </p>

      <p class="question">
        Tomorrow, he will have to choose again.
      </p>

        This is only one small fragment of <em>Rickshaw Boy</em>.
        In the full novel, Xiangzi’s choices are heavier, the losses deeper,
        and the city much harsher than one day can show.
