        Xiangzi chooses work. The morning air is cold, but he pulls the rickshaw
        into the street. The city wakes up slowly: shop doors open,
        bicycles ring their bells, tram lines hum in the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        A passenger waves at him. It is a short ride, but it pays fairly.
        Xiangzi counts the coins in his hand and imagines them added
        to his small hidden savings. His dream feels one tiny step closer.
      </p>

      <p>
        After some hours, the sky turns bright. The street becomes crowded.
        Suddenly, a group of soldiers walks past. They stop near the rickshaw stand.
      </p>

      <p class="question">
        Xiangzi feels something is wrong. Should he stay visible on the street,
        or quietly move away into a side alley?
      </p>
